Summary: Technical talk from Matt Bauer about Unity animator state machines in Nauticus Act III. Simplify Unity state machines into manageable sub-components.

I was having trouble finding examples on the internet on how to create complex animator state machines using Unity, so I came up with my own solution and made a tutorial on how I implemented it.

If you have any questions about this issue or others I have posted, leave us a comment on the Youtube video or check out our Sunday afternoon podcasts at <a href="http://twitch.tv/finalparsec">twitch.tv/finalparsec</a>.
