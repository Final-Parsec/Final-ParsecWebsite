Summary: A first look at Nauticus, Final Parsec's upcoming pirate adventure.


<p>
Caught in the golden age of piracy and a zombie apocalypse, Piro is forced into a life of heroism.
Zombies have overrun major ports, and the isolation of the sea has enabled him to survive.
The only remaining member of his crew is Hope, the sole wench to have plundered his heart.
Nauticus is a three-act tale of betrayal, survival, pillaging, and booty as the two seek refuge with an old friend.
