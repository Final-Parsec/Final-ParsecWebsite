Summary: Video tutorial about turrets and missiles in a rail shooter built with Unity3d. 

This is a continuation of Final Parsec's tutorial series on building a space-themed rail shooter with Unity3d.
Combat in this game involves dodging fire from ground based turrets.

In this tutorial, I'll be going over how to build turrets which detect the player using colliders.
Then we'll discuss how to make the turret face the player and fire.

You can follow along with the development of the project and find the source code from the tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/Final-Parsec/Blueshift).
