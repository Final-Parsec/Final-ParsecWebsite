Summary: Video tutorial about managing enemy health in a rail shooter built with Unity3d. We'll also discuss killing enemies in fiery explosions. 

This is a continuation of Final Parsec's tutorial series on building a space-themed rail shooter with Unity3d.
In previous tutorials, we've discussed enemies detecting and firing at the player.
Now we have come to the point where the player needs to be able to fight back.

In this video tutorial, I'll discuss managing the health of enemies when they get shot by the player.
Then we'll discuss how to make the enemies blow up and be removed from the game when they are dead.

You can follow along with the development of the project and find the source code from the tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/Final-Parsec/Blueshift).
