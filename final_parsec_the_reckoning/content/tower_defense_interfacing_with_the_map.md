Summary: The second video tutorial of a series which takes you through the process of building a tower defense game. 

<p>
    So now that you have a grid environment similar to what we built in the <a href="/tower-defense-no-gameobject-grid.html">previous tutorial</a>, it's time to actually start using it.
    This tutorial goes over how the user interfaces and interacts with the map.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, the primary interaction with the map will be handling a player's clicks and placing turrets for them.
    It is necessary to ensure the turrets are placed at valid locations, and also to update the paths of enemies as the world changes around them.
    In this tutorial, we dig into placing turrets on the map.

<p>
    Upcoming tutorials cover getting enemies to move around and making the turrets attack, so be sure to check back!
