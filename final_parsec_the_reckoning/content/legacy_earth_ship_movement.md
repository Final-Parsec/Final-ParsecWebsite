Summary: Video tutorial about ship and camera movement in a rail shooter built with Unity3d. 

Our new game is going to be a space rail shooter. 
Similar to the Star Fox series, we plan on creating an immersive story with a simple user interface.
The enemies will be ground turrets and flying types with multiple engagement modes.
There will also be unique boss battles at the end of most of the levels.

In this tutorial I'll be going over the ship and camera movement.

We have our up to date source code and project files on [GitHub](https://github.com/Final-Parsec/Blueshift).
