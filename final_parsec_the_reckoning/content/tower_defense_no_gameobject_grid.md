<h3>Building a Grid Environment without GameObjects</h3>

<p>
    This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a grid without using Unity GameObjects.
    By eliminating the overhead of multiple GameObjects, we can increase performance.
    The grid we're building here will be a vital piece of infrastructure as enemies will walk across it, turrets will be placed on it, and it will handle user interaction in various ways.
