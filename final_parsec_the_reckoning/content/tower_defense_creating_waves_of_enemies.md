Summary: The fourth video tutorial of a series which takes you through the process of building a tower defense game. 

<p>
    This tutorial goes over how to create random waves of enemies.
    The waves include bosses every 10th wave and different types of enemies. 
    Waves are sent either when an interval of time has passed or the player has commanded a new wave. 
    Also, multiple waves can be actively spawning enemies at the same time.
