Summary: The fifth video tutorial of a series which takes you through the process of building a tower defense game. 

<p>
    This tutorial goes over how to pass data between scenes using the singleton pattern, something especially useful when a user is picking map types and difficulty in a separate menu scene.
    We also give an overview of building a menu system with Prezi-style transitions (panning and zooming camera with parallax effects).

<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KYADPkNTEHM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>
    In addition to building the menu and passing state data around, learn how to display a loading screen between scenes.
    Without this, the game may appear to hang when a player starts from the main menu.
